Subject: Re: Urgent - Need Full Stack Dev ASAP!!! 

Hey everyone! 

So we just lost our lead developer (long story, don't ask lol) and we REALLY need someone to jump in quickly. StartupXYZ is this awesome fintech company that's growing super fast - we just raised our Series A and everything is crazy right now.

We're based in Austin, Texas but honestly with COVID and everything, most of our team works remotely anyway. The office is nice though if you want to come in - we have a ping pong table and free kombucha on tap (yes really).

Anyway, we need a Full Stack Software Engineer who can hit the ground running. Here's what we're looking for:

- Someone with at least 3+ years doing React and Node.js (please don't apply if you just did a bootcamp last month, we need experience)
- MongoDB experience would be amazing since that's what we use
- AWS knowledge is super helpful too
- Bonus points if you've worked at a startup before and understand the chaos

The salary range is $90,000 to $120,000 depending on experience. We also have equity (could be worth millions someday, who knows!) and good health insurance.

Oh and we're doing interviews this week so please respond quickly if interested!

Thanks,
Sarah (CTO)
sarah@startupxyz.com

P.S. - Please ignore my previous email about the office pizza party being cancelled. The pizza situation has been resolved.

Subject: Data Scientist Opening - Big Tech Corp - San Francisco

Hello Stanford Career Services,

I hope this email finds you well. We met at the career fair last month and you mentioned you might have some recent PhD graduates who would be interested in data science roles.

Big Tech Corp (you've definitely heard of us - we're the company that makes that app everyone uses) is expanding our SF team and we have an exciting opportunity for a Data Scientist to join our AI Research division.

A bit about the role:
We're looking for someone really smart (obviously) who can work with our massive datasets to build predictive models and help drive product decisions. You'll be working with our senior data science team led by Dr. Jennifer Martinez (she used to be at Google and published like 50 papers on machine learning).

The position is full-time and based in our San Francisco headquarters (the one with the cool slide between floors that went viral on Instagram). 

Requirements (please read carefully - we get a lot of unqualified applicants):
- PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, or related quantitative field
- At least 5 years of hands-on Python programming experience 
- Deep expertise in machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling
- Experience with TensorFlow or PyTorch (we use both depending on the project)
- Strong communication skills (you'll need to explain complex models to non-technical stakeholders)
- Previous experience with large-scale data processing preferred

We offer a very competitive compensation package including base salary, equity, and comprehensive benefits. The exact numbers depend on experience level but it's definitely above market rate.

If you know any qualified candidates, please have them apply through our website or send their resume directly to me.

Best regards,
Michael Chen
Senior Talent Acquisition Manager
